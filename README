So I want a UFC api that will specifically pull data from live fights.
UPDATE:
The UFC have finally barred people from srapping their site... I may
have to rebuild using sherdog. It really is a shame.


Where can i pull this data?
    UFC live stats page, possibly
    sherdog?
    mma sites?

How can I: ufc doesn't seem to have its own endpoints
    HTML parsing seems to be the way.


This API will be for scrapping information on live fights

Funct:
    (probably want to implement filter funct later)
    Given that a card is going on right now
    Get a list of fights on the card
        :list may have fighters, results, etc
    get current fight data 
        :fighters fighting
        :time? may be possible
        :stats (strikes, grappling, etc)
