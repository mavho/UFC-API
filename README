TODO:
Make prediction model better.
More routes for the api.
Deploy on some server (AWS, Azure, what ever), and create an autonomous framework.

make the rotating proxy better... probably make another webscraper for that hahahah
Create another proxy method to get a list of upcoming fights

Make it multithreaded.
Make it distributed (for fun).


Do front end.

What's finished:
You can access this api at
http://3.134.85.95/api/winners to receive a list of all predicted winners for the next fight.
Currently there is only one endpoint.

What I want completed:
A site where users can see the upcoming UFC fight, and the site - server, whatever, will
give the users a fight prediction for that fight. 

Currently:
I'm still in school, and this is a busy quarter. However this is a project I want to complete by,
this quarter so I'll try to give weekly updates. Working on a distributed systems project as well as
an android video game.
