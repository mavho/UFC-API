So I want a UFC api that will specifically pull data from live fights.
UPDATE:
So functionality for this will be a little different.
This is currently a backend framework for a fight predicter.
I don't really have any experience in data science, but I"m more interested in building the api.

Currently I have data of a lot of fights.
Currently api is very bare bones, but more functionality will be provided.

TODO:
Make prediction model better.
More routes for the api.
Deploy on some server (AWS, Azure, what ever), and create an autonomous framework.

Do front end.

What I want completed:
A site where users can see the upcoming UFC fight, and the site - server, whatever, will
give the users a fight prediction for that fight. 

Currently:
I'm still in school, and this is a busy quarter. However this is a project I want to complete by,
this quarter so I'll try to give weekly updates. Working on a distributed systems project as well as
an android video game.
